 Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

First of all, I would pin point that never be confused with JavaScript object and other language object concept they differ a lot internally. so, people who come from different language like Java/c++ they make a biggest mistake to compare with JavaScript object with others.

Coming to the point,

In simple terms. “A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.

For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.
1.In javascript object is a collection of key value pairs that represent properties of an entity.

2.The keys are strings or symbols and the values can be any data type including other objects.

3.The internal representation of an object in java script is called object structure or object layout.

4.It designed to be fat and efficient for property lookups and other operations in objects.

5.An object is a reference data type in the form of key:value pairs

6.access the properties of an object with the simple dot notation.
For Example: objectName.propertyName.
